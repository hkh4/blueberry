\section{Introduction}
This language is used to write sheet music for guitar tabs. Maybe in the future it'll be able to write normal sheet music as well! 


\section{Design Principles}
I want the language to be as simple and intuitive as possible. The syntax is very simple, and a lot of the formatting is taken care of by the evaluator, which means that there are default values for a lot of parameters, making life easier for the user. 


\section{Example Programs}
Minimal example:

-type tab\\
-time 4-4\\
-key c\\

1:\\
\quad 3e4\\
\quad 4g\\
\quad 1g\\
2:\\
\quad 5a\\
\quad 1f\\


Output:
