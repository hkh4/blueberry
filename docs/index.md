# Usage

In order to run the program, you need to have [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) installed. Follow the instructions for downloading and setup.

## Mac

Download the packages above and clone this repo into an easily accessible location.

### Running Within the Blueberry Folder

1. The quickest way to run the program is directly in the cloned repo. Open terminal, and navigate to the lang folder within blueberry.

   ```shell
   cd path-to-folder/blueberry/lang
   ```

2. Create a new file to write your code in. I suggest using the .blb extension for easy-of-use, but any extension works.

3. Run using dotnet. It will create a .ps file with the specified name.

   ```shell
   dotnet run <filename> <output filename>
   ```

4. Use ps2pdf, a command line tool from Ghostscript, to convert the postscript file to a pdf. If you get an error, you may need to add ghostscript to your PATH variable.
   ```shell
   ps2pdf -dNOSAFER <file>.ps
   ```
### Running From Separate Folder

1. To run the program on files in a separate folder, I suggest writing a custom script to do the job for you. Follow [this link](https://medium.com/devnetwork/how-to-create-your-own-custom-terminal-commands-c5008782a78e) for instructions on how to set up a file with custom scripts. Once created, add the following, replace PATHTOFILE with the path to wherever you cloned the blueberry folder:
   ```shell
   function pspdf() {
      ps2pdf -dNOSAFER $1.ps
      open $1.pdf
   }

   function blb() {
      if [[ "$#" == 0 ]]; then
      echo 'Usage: blb <file with code> <name of output file>'
      return 0
      fi
      if [ -z "$2" ]
         then
            OUTFILE='score'
      else
         OUTFILE=$2
      fi
      cwd=$(pwd)
      cd ~/PATHTOFILE/blueberry/lang
      dotnet run $cwd/$1 $OUTFILE
      pspdf $OUTFILE
      rm $OUTFILE.ps
      mv $OUTFILE.pdf $cwd
      cd $cwd
   }
   ```
Now, you can create files anywhere on your computer, and run it using `blb <filename> <outputFile>`
