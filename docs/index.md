# Usage

In order to run the program, you need to have [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) installed. Follow the instructions for downloading and setup.

## Mac

Download the packages above and clone this repo into an easily accessible location.

### Running Within the Blueberry Folder

1. The quickest way to run the program is directly in the cloned repo. Open terminal, and navigate to the lang folder within blueberry.

   ```shell
   cd path-to-folder/blueberry/lang
   ```

2. Create a new file to write your code in. I suggest using the .blb extension for easy-of-use, but any extension works.

3. Run using dotnet. It will create a .ps file with the specified name.

   ```shell
   dotnet run <filename> <output filename>
   ```

4. Use ps2pdf, a command line tool from Ghostscript, to convert the postscript file to a pdf. If you get an error, you may need to add ghostscript to your PATH variable.
   ```shell
   ps2pdf -dNOSAFER <file>.ps
   ```
### Running From Separate Folder

1. To run the program on files in a separate folder, I suggest writing a custom script to do the job for you. Follow [this link](https://medium.com/devnetwork/how-to-create-your-own-custom-terminal-commands-c5008782a78e) for instructions on how to set up a file with custom scripts. Once created, add the following, replacing PATHTOFILE with the path to wherever you cloned the blueberry folder:
   ```shell
   function pspdf() {
      ps2pdf -dNOSAFER $1.ps
      open $1.pdf
   }

   function blb() {
      if [[ "$#" == 0 ]]; then
      echo 'Usage: blb <file with code> <name of output file>'
      return 0
      fi
      if [ -z "$2" ]
         then
            OUTFILE='score'
      else
         OUTFILE=$2
      fi
      cwd=$(pwd)
      cd ~/PATHTOFILE/blueberry/lang
      dotnet run $cwd/$1 $OUTFILE
      pspdf $OUTFILE
      rm $OUTFILE.ps
      mv $OUTFILE.pdf $cwd
      cd $cwd
   }
   ```
Now, you can create files anywhere on your computer, and run it using `blb <filename> <outputFile>`!


## Windows

Download the packages above and clone this repo into an easily accessible location. In addition, make sure you have [Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The instructions for running within the blueberry folder should be the same as for Mac users. Use the terminal function within VsCode. In addition, check out this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6011373/call-ghostscript-in-windows-by-its-invocation-name#:~:text=Open%20a%20cmd%20window%20and,64%20bit%20Windows) for how to use the ghostscript functions in the terminal. I'm not familiar with scripting on Windows and how to create a script to run the program from other folders.


# Documentation

## Basic Syntax

   ```   
   -title Example
   -composer Person
   -key c
   -time 4-4
   -capo 1

   1:
      1f4
      3g#
      5d8/sli
      5f8
      4e4
   2:
      2e16/sls
      2f16
      2g
      2a/sle
      6bb2
      1f8/gra
      2a4
   ```

![General setup](img/general.png)

Each file begins with options that control certain aspects of the tab. They begin with a `-`, followed by the option name, and the chosen parameter. Next, each measure begins with the measure number, a colon, and the notes on separate lines with a tab (or at least a space).

## Options

Here are the valid options:

   ```
   -title Blueberry
   -composer Hugo Hua
   -key d#m
   -time 4-4
   -capo 2
   ```

The title and composer can be whatever you choose, and the capo is an integer.

### Key

Valid keys are:

* c
* cm
* c#
* c#m
* cb
* d
* dm
* db
* d#m
* e
* em
* eb
* ebm
* f
* fm
* f#m
* f#
* g
* gm
* g#m
* gb
* a
* am
* a#m
* ab
* abm
* b
* bm
* bb
* bbm

Notes that are entered will be automatically changed based on the key chosen.

### Time

Time signatures are of the format `<top>-<bottom>`. The first number can be a number between 1-32, or 64, and the second number can be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64.

## Single Notes

Notes follow the format `<string number><pitch><rhythm><properties>`. Here are some examples:

   ```
   1e4
   5f#16/gra
   6gn8../gra/slu
   ```

The first number is which string on the guitar the note appears on, with 1 being the lowerst and 6 being the highest.

&nbsp;

The following are valid pitches:

* c
* c#
* cb
* cn
* d
* d#
* db
* dn
* e
* e#
* eb
* en
* f
* f#
* fb
* fn
* g
* g#
* gb
* gn
* a
* a#
* ab
* an
* b
* b#
* bb
* bn
* x

Notes with an `n` are natural notes, which differ from regular notes in that the key signature will not change them. The `x` represents a percussive note rather than a pitch; it shows up as an "X" rather than a fret number. Using the pitches, key signature, and capo, the program calculates the fret for that note on the given string. The default is the lowest possible fret, but there is a property that can raise frets, which will be explained in the [properties]() section.
