# Usage

In order to run the program, you need to have [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) installed. Follow the instructions for downloading and setup.

## Mac

Download the packages above and clone this repo into an easily accessible location.

### Running Within the Blueberry Folder

1. The quickest way to run the program is directly in the cloned repo. Open terminal, and navigate to the lang folder within blueberry.

   ```shell
   cd path-to-folder/blueberry/lang
   ```

2. Create a new file to write your code in. I suggest using the .blb extension for easy-of-use, but any extension works.

3. Run using dotnet. It will create a .ps file with the specified name.

   ```shell
   dotnet run <filename> <output filename>
   ```

4. Use ps2pdf, a command line tool from Ghostscript, to convert the postscript file to a pdf.
   ```shell
   ps2pdf -dNOSAFER <file>.ps
   ```
