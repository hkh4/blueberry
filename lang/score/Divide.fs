// ############ Step 1: Convert the AST into a SingleMeasure List

(* Helper method to figure out width and start of a note
1) template is the Element created by evalNote which will be modified
2) r is the Duration of this Element
3) nextStart is the start spot of this element, which will be updated and returned
4) baseBeat is the RhythmNumber of the time signature, this constitutes one beat
5) numberOfBeats is the top number of the time signature
6) last is an into - 1 if last note, 0 else
7) graceNotes is the list of grace notes for this element
RETURNS: new Element and the new nextStart for the next element
